    'This library connects your application with Google Analytics 4. It provides a set of SharedActions you can use in your project.
    
    ## How to use
    
    Install the library, and call the **InstallGA4** SharedAction in your application. The best place to call it is in a **[onNetWorkReachable](https://doc.convertigo.com/documentation/latest/reference-manual/convertigo-objects/mobile-application/components/control-components/appevent/)** Application Event. In this way the GA4 analytics will be installed when your application starts.
    
    This shared Action will require √† **Measurement ID** you will find in you Google Analytics Console **Data streams**. A **Measurement ID** is in the form of **G-XXXXXXXXXX**. You can pass this id in the **G_ID** variable.
    
    ## How to track visited pages
    
    The library provides a **PageEvent** sharedAction you can use to Track visited pages of your app. The best place to call it is in an **[AppGuard](https://doc.convertigo.com/documentation/latest/reference-manual/convertigo-objects/mobile-application/ngx-components/control-components/appguard/)** Application Event
    
    This way way each time a user navigates on page the **AppGuard** event will be triggered and your sharedAction will be called. 
    
    Note:  To be sure that you page will be entered correctly do not forget to add a **[CustomAction](https://doc.convertigo.com/documentation/latest/reference-manual/convertigo-objects/mobile-application/components/action-components/customaction/)** after calling the **PageEvent** SharedAction with a 
    
    `return true`
    
    JavaScript line to instruct the AppGuard to let the user navigate on the page.. 
    
    # How to notify special events
    
    The library also provides a **NotifyAevent** SharedAction to let you notify special events to Google Analytics 4  Just call this SharedAction anywhere in your application providing the **EventType** and **EventData** variables.
